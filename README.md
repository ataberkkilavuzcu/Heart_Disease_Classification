# Heart_Disease_Classification
In this project, I utilized supervised machine learning techniques to develop classification models for predicting the presence of heart disease using a dataset containing 303 entries with 14 attributes related to patient health. As models I used Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines and picked the best one according to their accuracies.
